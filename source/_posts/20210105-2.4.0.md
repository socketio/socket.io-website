Happy New Year everyone!

We just published a new minor version in the 2.x branch!

Please note that this release contains a breaking change regarding [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS).

**UPDATE**: this change was reverted in [2.4.1](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/releases/tag/2.4.1), because it did not follow semantic versioning and broke some deployments (discussed [here](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/discussions/3741)). Please make sure you are properly [securing your application](/docs/v2/handling-cors), and [upgrade](/docs/v3/migrating-from-2-x-to-3-0/) to Socket.IO v3 as soon as possible.

Previously, CORS was enabled by default, which meant that a Socket.IO server sent the necessary CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-xxx`) to **any** domain. This will not be the case anymore, and you now have to explicitly enable it.

Please note that you are not impacted if:

- you are using Socket.IO v2 and the `origins` option to restrict the list of allowed domains
- you are using Socket.IO v3 (disabled by default)

This change also removes the support for '*' matchers and protocol-less URL:

```
io.origins('https://example.com:443'); => io.origins(['https://example.com']);
io.origins('localhost:3000');          => io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
io.origins('http://localhost:*');      => io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
io.origins('*:3000');                  => io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
```

To restore the previous behavior (please use with caution):

```js
io.origins((_, callback) => {
  callback(null, true);
});
```

A big thanks to [@ni8walk3r](https://github.com/ni8walk3r) for the detailed security report.
