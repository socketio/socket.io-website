Connection state recovery is a feature which allows restoring a client's state after a temporary disconnection, including any missed packets.

:::info

This feature was added in version `4.6.0`, released in February 2023.

The release notes can be found [here](../../changelog/4.6.0.md).

:::

## Disclaimer

Under real conditions, a Socket.IO client will inevitably experience temporary disconnections, regardless of the quality of the connection.

This feature will help you cope with such disconnections, but please be aware that the recovery **will not always be successful**. That's why you will still need to handle the case where the states of the client and the server must be synchronized.

:::tip

Connection State Recovery will NOT be successful unless the client has received *at least* one event from the server

:::
## Usage

Connection state recovery must be enabled by the server:

```js
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  connectionStateRecovery: {
    // the backup duration of the sessions and the packets
    maxDisconnectionDuration: 2 * 60 * 1000,
    // whether to skip middlewares upon successful recovery
    skipMiddlewares: true,
  }
});
```

:::caution

The connection state recovery feature is designed for dealing with intermittent disconnections, so please use a sensible value for `maxDisconnectionDuration`.

:::

Upon an unexpected disconnection (i.e. no manual disconnection with `socket.disconnect()`), the server will store the `id`, the rooms and the `data` attribute of the socket.

Then upon reconnection, the server will try to restore the state of the client. The `recovered` attribute indicates whether this recovery was successful:

*Server*

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  if (socket.recovered) {
    // recovery was successful: socket.id, socket.rooms and socket.data were restored
  } else {
    // new or unrecoverable session
  }
});
```

*Client*

```js
socket.on("connect", () => {
  if (socket.recovered) {
    // any event missed during the disconnection period will be received now
  } else {
    // new or unrecoverable session
  }
});
```

You can check that the recovery is working by forcefully closing the underlying engine:

```js
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io({
  reconnectionDelay: 10000, // defaults to 1000
  reconnectionDelayMax: 10000 // defaults to 5000
});

socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log("recovered?", socket.recovered);

  setTimeout(() => {
    if (socket.io.engine) {
      // close the low-level connection and trigger a reconnection
      socket.io.engine.close();
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

[1] Persisting the packets is not compatible with the Redis PUB/SUB mechanism.

## How it works under the hood

- the server sends a session ID [during the handshake](../08-Miscellaneous/sio-protocol.md#connection-to-a-namespace-1) (which is different from the existing `id` attribute, which is public and can be freely shared)

Example:

```
40{"sid":"GNpWD7LbGCBNCr8GAAAB","pid":"YHcX2sdAF1z452-HAAAW"}

where

4         => the Engine.IO message type
0         => the Socket.IO CONNECT type
GN...AB   => the public id of the session
YH...AW   => the private id of the session
```

- the server also includes an offset in [each packet](../08-Miscellaneous/sio-protocol.md#sending-and-receiving-data-1) (added at the end of the data array, for backward compatibility)

Example:

```
42["foo","MzUPkW0"]

where

4         => the Engine.IO message type
2         => the Socket.IO EVENT type
foo       => the event name (socket.emit("foo"))
MzUPkW0   => the offset
```

:::note

For the recovery to succeed, the server must send at least one event, in order to initialize the offset on the client side.

:::

- upon temporary disconnection, the server stores the client state for a given delay (implemented at the adapter level)

- upon reconnection, the client sends both the session ID and the last offset it has processed, and the server tries to restore the state

Example:

```
40{"pid":"YHcX2sdAF1z452-HAAAW","offset":"MzUPkW0"}

where

4         => the Engine.IO message type
0         => the Socket.IO CONNECT type
YH...AW   => the private id of the session
MzUPkW0   => the last processed offset
```
