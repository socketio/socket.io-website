## Introduction {#introduction}

The Socket.IO protocol enables [full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#FULL-DUPLEX) and low-overhead communication between a client and a server.

It is built on top of [the Engine.IO protocol](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-protocol), which handles the low-level plumbing with WebSocket and HTTP long-polling.

The Socket.IO protocol adds the following features:

- multiplexing (referred as ["namespace"](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces) in the Socket.IO jargon)

Example with the JavaScript API:

*Server*

```js
// declare the namespace
const namespace = io.of("/admin");
// handle the connection to the namespace
namespace.on("connection", (socket) => {
  // ...
});
```

*Client*

```js
// reach the main namespace
const socket1 = io();
// reach the "/admin" namespace (with the same underlying WebSocket connection)
const socket2 = io("/admin");
// handle the connection to the namespace
socket2.on("connect", () => {
  // ...
});
```

- acknowledgement of packets

Example with the JavaScript API:

```js
// on one side
socket.emit("hello", "foo", (arg) => {
  console.log("received", arg);
});

// on the other side
socket.on("hello", (arg, ack) => {
  ack("bar");
});
```

The reference implementation is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):

- server: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io
- client: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client


## Exchange protocol {#exchange-protocol}

A Socket.IO packet contains the following fields:

- a packet type (integer)
- a namespace (string)
- optionally, a payload (Object | Array)
- optionally, an acknowledgment id (integer)

Here is the list of available packet types:

| Type          | ID  | Usage                                                                                 |
|---------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CONNECT       | 0   | Used during the [connection to a namespace](#connection-to-a-namespace).              |
| DISCONNECT    | 1   | Used when [disconnecting from a namespace](#disconnection-from-a-namespace).          |
| EVENT         | 2   | Used to [send data](#sending-and-receiving-data) to the other side.                   |
| ACK           | 3   | Used to [acknowledge](#acknowledgement) an event.                                     |
| CONNECT_ERROR | 4   | Used during the [connection to a namespace](#connection-to-a-namespace).              |
| BINARY_EVENT  | 5   | Used to [send binary data](#sending-and-receiving-data) to the other side.            |
| BINARY_ACK    | 6   | Used to [acknowledge](#acknowledgement) an event (the response includes binary data). |


### Connection to a namespace {#connection-to-a-namespace}

At the beginning of a Socket.IO session, the client MUST send a `CONNECT` packet:

The server MUST respond with either:

- a `CONNECT` packet if the connection is successful, with the session ID in the payload
- or a `CONNECT_ERROR` packet if the connection is not allowed

```
CLIENT                                                      SERVER

  │  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  │
  │             { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/" }              │
  │  ◄───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
  │   { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/", data: { sid: "..." } }  │
```

If the server does not receive a `CONNECT` packet first, then it MUST close the connection immediately.

A client MAY be connected to multiple namespaces at the same time, with the same underlying WebSocket connection.

Examples:

- with the main namespace (named `"/"`)

```
Client > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/" }
Server > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/", data: { sid: "wZX3oN0bSVIhsaknAAAI" } }
```

- with a custom namespace

```
Client > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/admin" }
Server > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/admin", data: { sid: "oSO0OpakMV_3jnilAAAA" } }
```

- with an additional payload

```
Client > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/admin", data: { "token": "123" } }
Server > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/admin", data: { sid: "iLnRaVGHY4B75TeVAAAB" } }
```

- in case the connection is refused

```
Client > { type: CONNECT, namespace: "/" }
Server > { type: CONNECT_ERROR, namespace: "/", data: { message: "Not authorized" } }
```

### Sending and receiving data {#sending-and-receiving-data}

Once the [connection to a namespace](#connection-to-a-namespace) is established, the client and the server can begin exchanging data:

```
CLIENT                                                      SERVER

  │  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  │
  │        { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo"] }      │
  │                                                            │
  │  ◄───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
  │        { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["bar"] }      │
```

The payload is mandatory and MUST be a non-empty array. If that's not the case, then the receiver MUST close the connection.

Examples:

- with the main namespace

```
Client > { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo"] }
```

- with a custom namespace

```
Server > { type: EVENT, namespace: "/admin", data: ["bar"] }
```

- with binary data

```
Client > { type: BINARY_EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["baz", <Buffer <01 02 03 04>> ] }
```

### Acknowledgement {#acknowledgement}

The sender MAY include an event ID in order to request an acknowledgement from the receiver:

```
CLIENT                                                      SERVER

  │  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  │
  │   { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo"], id: 12 }   │
  │  ◄───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
  │    { type: ACK, namespace: "/", data: ["bar"], id: 12 }    │
```

The receiver MUST respond with an `ACK` packet with the same event ID.

The payload is mandatory and MUST be an array (possibly empty).

Examples:

- with the main namespace

```
Client > { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo"], id: 12 }
Server > { type: ACK, namespace: "/", data: [], id: 12 }
```

- with a custom namespace

```
Server > { type: EVENT, namespace: "/admin", data: ["foo"], id: 13 }
Client > { type: ACK, namespace: "/admin", data: ["bar"], id: 13 }
```

- with binary data

```
Client > { type: BINARY_EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo", <buffer <01 02 03 04> ], id: 14 }
Server > { type: ACK, namespace: "/", data: ["bar"], id: 14 }

or

Server > { type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo" ], id: 15 }
Client > { type: BINARY_ACK, namespace: "/", data: ["bar", <buffer <01 02 03 04>], id: 15 }
```

### Disconnection from a namespace {#disconnection-from-a-namespace}

At any time, one side can end the connection to a namespace by sending a `DISCONNECT` packet:

```
CLIENT                                                      SERVER

  │  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  │
  │           { type: DISCONNECT, namespace: "/" }             │
```

No response is expected from the other side. The low-level connection MAY be kept alive if the client is connected to another namespace.


## Packet encoding {#packet-encoding}

This section details the encoding used by the default parser which is included in Socket.IO server and client, and
whose source can be found [here](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-parser).

The JavaScript server and client implementations also supports custom parsers, which have different tradeoffs and may benefit to
certain kind of applications. Please see [socket.io-json-parser](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-json-parser)
or [socket.io-msgpack-parser](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-msgpack-parser) for example.

Please also note that each Socket.IO packet is sent as a Engine.IO `message` packet (more information [here](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-protocol)),
so the encoded result will be prefixed by the character `"4"` when sent over the wire (in the request/response body with HTTP
long-polling, or in the WebSocket frame).

### Format {#format}

```
<packet type>[<# of binary attachments>-][<namespace>,][<acknowledgment id>][JSON-stringified payload without binary]

+ binary attachments extracted
```

Note: the namespace is only included if it is different from the main namespace (`/`)

### Examples {#examples}

#### Connection to a namespace {#connection-to-a-namespace-1}

- with the main namespace

*Packet*

```
{ type: CONNECT, namespace: "/" }
```

*Encoded*

```
0
```

- with a custom namespace

*Packet*

```
{ type: CONNECT, namespace: "/admin", data: { sid: "oSO0OpakMV_3jnilAAAA" } }
```

*Encoded*

```
0/admin,{"sid":"oSO0OpakMV_3jnilAAAA"}
```

- in case the connection is refused

*Packet*

```
{ type: CONNECT_ERROR, namespace: "/", data: { message: "Not authorized" } }
```

*Encoded*

```
4{"message":"Not authorized"}
```

#### Sending and receiving data {#sending-and-receiving-data-1}

- with the main namespace

*Packet*

```
{ type: EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["foo"] }
```

*Encoded*

```
2["foo"]
```

- with a custom namespace

*Packet*

```
{ type: EVENT, namespace: "/admin", data: ["bar"] }
```

*Encoded*

```
2/admin,["bar"]
```

- with binary data

*Packet*

```
{ type: BINARY_EVENT, namespace: "/", data: ["baz", <Buffer <01 02 03 04>> ] }
```

*Encoded*

```
51-["baz",{"_placeholder":true,"num":0}]

+ <Buffer <01 02 03 04>>
```

52-/admin,["baz",{"_placeholder":true,"num":0},{"_placeholder":true,"num":1}]

+ <Buffer <01 02>>
+ <Buffer <03 04>>

## History {#history}

### Difference between v5 and v4 {#difference-between-v5-and-v4}

The 5th revision (current) of the Socket.IO protocol is used in Socket.IO v3 and above (`v3.0.0` was released in November 2020).

It is built on top of the 4th revision of [the Engine.IO protocol](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-protocol) (hence the `EIO=4` query parameter).

List of changes:

- remove the implicit connection to the default namespace

In previous versions, a client was always connected to the default namespace, even if it requested access to another namespace.

This is not the case anymore, the client must send a `CONNECT` packet in any case.

Commits: [09b6f23](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/09b6f2333950b8afc8c1400b504b01ad757876bd) (server) and [249e0be](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/249e0bef9071e7afd785485961c4eef0094254e8) (client)


- rename `ERROR` to `CONNECT_ERROR`

The meaning and the code number (4) are not modified: this packet type is still used by the server when the connection to a namespace is refused. But we feel the name is more self-descriptive.

Commits: [d16c035](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d16c035d258b8deb138f71801cb5aeedcdb3f002) (server) and [13e1db7c](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/13e1db7c94291c583d843beaa9e06ee041ae4f26) (client).


- the `CONNECT` packet now can contain a payload

The client can send a payload for authentication/authorization purposes. Example:

```json
{
  "type": 0,
  "nsp": "/admin",
  "data": {
    "token": "123"
  }
}
```

In case of success, the server responds with a payload contain the ID of the Socket. Example:

```json
{
  "type": 0,
  "nsp": "/admin",
  "data": {
    "sid": "CjdVH4TQvovi1VvgAC5Z"
  }
}
```

This change means that the ID of the Socket.IO connection will now be different from the ID of the underlying Engine.IO connection (the one that is found in the query parameters of the HTTP requests).

Commits: [2875d2c](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/2875d2cfdfa463e64cb520099749f543bbc4eb15) (server) and [bbe94ad](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/bbe94adb822a306c6272e977d394e3e203cae25d) (client)


- the payload `CONNECT_ERROR` packet is now an object instead of a plain string

Commits: [54bf4a4](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/54bf4a44e9e896dfb64764ee7bd4e8823eb7dc7b) (server) and [0939395](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/09393952e3397a0c71f239ea983f8ec1623b7c21) (client)


### Difference between v4 and v3 {#difference-between-v4-and-v3}

The 4th revision of the Socket.IO protocol is used in Socket.IO v1 (`v1.0.3` was released in June 2014) and v2 (`v2.0.0` was released in May 2017).

The details of the revision can be found here: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-protocol/tree/v4

It is built on top of the 3rd revision of [the Engine.IO protocol](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-protocol) (hence the `EIO=3` query parameter).

List of changes:

- add a `BINARY_ACK` packet type

Previously, an `ACK` packet was always treated as if it may contain binary objects, with recursive search for such
objects, which could hurt performance.

Reference: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-parser/commit/ca4f42a922ba7078e840b1bc09fe3ad618acc065

### Difference between v3 and v2 {#difference-between-v3-and-v2}

The 3rd revision of the Socket.IO protocol is used in early Socket.IO v1 versions (`socket.io@1.0.0...1.0.2`) (released in May 2014).

The details of the revision can be found here: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-protocol/tree/v3

List of changes:

- remove the usage of msgpack to encode packets containing binary objects (see also [299849b](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-parser/commit/299849b00294c3bc95817572441f3aca8ffb1f65))

### Difference between v2 and v1 {#difference-between-v2-and-v1}

List of changes:

- add a `BINARY_EVENT` packet type

This was added during the work towards Socket.IO 1.0, in order to add support for binary objects. The `BINARY_EVENT`
packets were encoded with [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/).

### Initial revision {#initial-revision}

This first revision was the result of the split between the Engine.IO protocol (low-level plumbing with WebSocket / HTTP
long-polling, heartbeat) and the Socket.IO protocol. It was never included in a Socket.IO release, but paved the way for
the next iterations.

## Test suite {#test-suite}

The test suite in the [`test-suite/`](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-protocol/tree/main/test-suite) directory lets you check the compliance of a server implementation.

Usage:

- in Node.js: `npm ci && npm test`
- in a browser: simply open the `index.html` file in your browser

For reference, here is expected configuration for the JavaScript server to pass all tests:

```js
import { Server } from "socket.io";

const io = new Server(3000, {
  pingInterval: 300,
  pingTimeout: 200,
  maxPayload: 1000000,
  cors: {
    origin: "*"
  }
});

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.emit("auth", socket.handshake.auth);

  socket.on("message", (...args) => {
    socket.emit.apply(socket, ["message-back", ...args]);
  });

  socket.on("message-with-ack", (...args) => {
    const ack = args.pop();
    ack(...args);
  })
});

io.of("/custom").on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.emit("auth", socket.handshake.auth);
});
```
