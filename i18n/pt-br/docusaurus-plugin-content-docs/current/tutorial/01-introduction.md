# Getting started

Welcome to the Socket.IO tutorial!

In this tutorial we'll create a basic chat application. It requires almost no basic prior knowledge of Node.JS or Socket.IO, so it’s ideal for users of all knowledge levels.

## Introduction

Writing a chat application with popular web applications stacks like LAMP (PHP) has normally been very hard. It involves polling the server for changes, keeping track of timestamps, and it’s a lot slower than it should be.

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.

This means that the server can *push* messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

## How to use this tutorial

### Tooling

Any text editor (from a basic text editor to a complete IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) should be sufficient to complete this tutorial.

Additionally, at the end of each step you will find a link to some online platforms ([CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) and [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), namely), allowing you to run the code directly from your browser:

### Syntax settings

In the Node.js world, there are two ways to import modules:

- the standard way: ECMAScript modules (or ESM)

```js
import { Server } from "socket.io";
```

Reference: https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html

- the legacy way: CommonJS

```js
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
```

Reference: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html

Socket.IO supports both syntax. 

:::tip

We recommend using the ESM syntax in your project, though this might not always be feasible due to some packages not supporting this syntax.

:::

For your convenience, throughout the tutorial, each code block allows you to select your preferred syntax:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
  <TabItem value="cjs" label="CommonJS" default>

```js
const { Server } = require("socket.io");
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mjs" label="ES modules">

```js
import { Server } from "socket.io";
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
